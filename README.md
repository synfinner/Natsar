# README.md

This python script is designed to pull Telegram bot update information, such as each user that is issuing updates. 

Part of the fun of this script is that I wanted to see if it could be done entirely--or limited in intervention--with GitHub CoPilot. 

Installation: 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This is an ongoing project, please feel free to keep checking back as I add functions and more!
